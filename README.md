## Market Access / Market Potential Analysis

### Objective 
The objective of this analysis is to identify, for a range of origin points, what their accessibility relationship is to all of the destination points. The assessed trips can be by car, by bicycle, or on foot. 

### Definitions
‘Market access’ is a measure of accessibility from one origin to all destinations, based purely on time. The outcome of this analysis is often visualized as an ‘isochrone’, centered on a given origin point. Isochrones depict how far away from the origin you can move, in all directions, within a certain time frame. (E.g. 1 hour) . 
‘Market potential’ can be assessed by weighting all potential destinations by a factor designed to represent their attractiveness to the origin point. In the context of performing commercial site selection, such factors might include GDP per capita or population (positively related), or the number of other firms (negatively related). 
We refer to each origin – destination pair as an ‘O-D’ pair, and the matrix of travel times from all origin points to all destination points as an ‘O-D matrix’. An example of such a matrix is given below for five origin and destination points, A to E:
